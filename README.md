# imt577-nam14d
Personal repo to hold assignments for class IMT577. Each folder is associated with a different assignment.

1. Project Planning asked us to look through the data we were given, identify facts and dimensions for a dimensional model later on, and visualize how we would answer specific questions. This involved the creation of synthetic data (shown through the Jupyter notebook)

How did Store 577's performance compare to its actual sales throughout 2019?

2. ERD Exercises had our class create dimensional models for a few different business scenarios; the ones here aren't completely correct (Where are the surrogate keys?), but they aren't bad for a first shot.
